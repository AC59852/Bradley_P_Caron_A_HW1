The webpage we designed is fairly simple; it is a brief summary on both of our lives with an image included as a profile picture, a description of ourselves, our interests, hobbies, 
hometown, etc. 

We both also included an image of our favourite videogame with another brief description revolving around the context of the game and why we chose to specify the game as 
our favourite. 

Last but not least, a soundcloud link has also been embedded for background audio and with no copyright infringment as it was produced by one of ourselves. 

Also to note, the layout of our design is almost the exact same as we decided we did not want to confuse or frustrate the page user, so the size, colour, and typeface of the font are the
exact same with only the actual text varying.
